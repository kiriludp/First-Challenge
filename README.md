# First-Challenge

We were given a webpage code for a marketing agency that wants to add accessibility standards to their codebase for optimized search engines. Reviewing the code, we had an opportunity to update coding language from <div> to the more informative semantic HTML verbiage. Making these changers allows for a cleaner code and easier maintenance. 

Additionally, in order to support accessibility standards, we wanted to ensure that screen readers were able to utilize the webpage to the highest degree and offer the same experience for all individuals.


## Screen Shots of Updated Code ##

When first given the code to review and debug, the majority of the work was done using the <div> tags. In order to keep our work clean, concise, and easily managable, it was best to update this code to better reflect HTML5 guidelines. Please see examples of the before and after of what this code layout reflects. 


## Altermative Accessibility ##

Creating webpages that allow for all individuals to properly interact with the page is imperitive to any business. We made sure to edit the code to include alternative text for each image and icon that can be read by any screen reader. The alternative text gives detailed explanations while not overwhelming the document. 

## FlexBox ##

The use of flexboxes was impertivite in ensuring proper allignment on the webpage no matter the size of the screen. This allowed all the navigation links to maintain their uses and not get lost visually.

This code was based on code given to and created by the Bootcamp staff.
Collaboration took place between myself and Kara Anderson.
